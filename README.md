## Maker's Academy week 1 Challenge

A program that will emulate all the docking stations, bikes and infrastructure required to deliver a new bike system to Transport for London.

Pair partner: Alison Woodman.
We continued to work through the challenges, starting off at exercise 13.
The program now:
- doesn't allow the user to dock a bike if the station has reached capacity
- sets the default capacity to 20
- allows the user to set the capacity
- allows the user to report a broken bike
- doesn't release a broken bike from the station
